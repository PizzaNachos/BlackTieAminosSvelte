    question: "What is Toffee?",
    answer: `Toffee is a classic crunchy candy made from sugar and butter. 
        It is normally cooked with nuts (almonds specifically) and coated in chocolate.
        No one is quite sure where toffee truly comes from but in america we generally
        call it "English Style" toffee (even though its almost certainly not from England).
        Due to the high heat that toffee is cooked to, it develops a deep caramelized flavor
        and richness. `,

  {
    question: "What is Butterscotch?",
    answer: `Butterscotch is a very old candy that can be made a million different ways. 
        Unlike the artificially flavored hard candies you can find in the supermarket isle we cook our butterscotch soft and chewy.`,

  {
    question: "What is Brittle?",
    answer: `Brittle is a vague term that usually means a hard candy with nuts in it. 
        Normally brittle is cooked with no butter at all. This gives brittle a harder and more brittle (hence the name) glass like texture.
        We think this is the wrong way to cook brittle, we include plenty of butter in our recipe to give our brittles an unmatched richness and depth.`,
